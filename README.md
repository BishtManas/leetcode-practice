# 🚀 LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! This repo contains my personal solutions to problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), organized by topic and difficulty. It's intended as a learning resource for myself and others who are also preparing for technical interviews or looking to improve their problem-solving skills.

Each solution typically includes:
- ✅ Problem link
- 💡 Approach/Explanation
- 🧠 Complexity Analysis (Time & Space)
- 🧪 Code (Python)

> **Note:** I try to follow clean coding practices and use meaningful variable names and comments wherever helpful.

## 🔍 Topics Covered

- ✅ Arrays & Hashing  
- ✅ Strings  
- ✅ Two Pointers  
- ✅ Sliding Window  
- ✅ Stack & Queue  
- ✅ Linked List  
- ✅ Trees & Graphs  
- ✅ Binary Search  
- ✅ Recursion & Backtracking  
- ✅ Dynamic Programming  
- ✅ Greedy Algorithms  
- ✅ Bit Manipulation  
- ✅ Math & Geometry  

> More topics will be added as I progress.
