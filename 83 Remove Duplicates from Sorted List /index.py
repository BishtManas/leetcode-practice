# This program removes duplicates values from a sorted linked list.
# Since the list is sorted, all duplicated come one after another.
# I loop through the list and skip any repeated values using simple pointer logic.
# It's done in-place, meaning I didn't use any extra space -- just updated the .next pointer directly.
